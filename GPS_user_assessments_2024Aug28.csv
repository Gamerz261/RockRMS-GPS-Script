From the works of C.S. Lewis and J. R. Tolkien, to the story of Martin the mouse in Red-wall. I have had people watch movies that have a christian message, have lent out the book ""Oath"" by Frank Pierrette so often that I have owned a 5 copies of it and counting throughout my life. The other three take some deeper thought.","I have always been one who took the ""Five loves and Two fish"" as a guide on how to teach. A full belly will be able to feed and nourish the mind which will feed and nourish the soul. My favorite times in church are always the Church Potlucks.","Having been to the docs so often when i was young due to illness and chronic conditions I have felt that those people need to be reached out to. I picked my target ages because those are the people that the Church as it stands are missing. As people age they tend to return to the church for security of the soul (Prodigal son) so their is already outreach. But for someone 18 to 56 their is not real group that targets them. They get lumped into the older group for the 50+ or left in limbo after 17+ (College and careers groups have a tendency not to work as well and turn into a form of christian mingle and not the discipleship out reach that is truly needed) But if I just stopped after college age (18-24) I will be missing all the people that are 25 to 49. This group is heard to target because what ends up happening is we create micro social structures to subdivide the age range (Single, Married, Children, Divorced, Widowed....) But those are just stages of life, not that actual age range. A 19 year old can easily be a widow just like a 45 year old could be single. I want to create a group that would allow people to get to know their fellow brothers and sister in Christ without the social stratification. I feel that more can be developed from a single 26 year old talking and learning with the married 32 year olds and the 44 year old widow could bring the wisdom that God has brought her. Long story long the current small groups and disciple ship training has missed two entire generations of people and needs to be fixed.","I don't really know I am still chewing on those results.","I would want Him to do it His way.

The willingness to believe in something unseen, at least until it is clear that it is false, is the same willingness that leads a Christian to believe that Jesus is real.

But when I looked back later, I realized that God’s plan for everything in my life was so much better than mine.  So, I love to pray for people because I know that God is in control and His way is perfect.  
2) Knowledge - As long as I can remember, I have participated in Bible studies.  I have participated in BSF for almost 10 years.  Starting a couple of years ago, I developed an intense hunger for the Word.  I now want knowledge, but more importantly, I want a closer, more intimate relationship with Jesus and what He is saying to me through His Word.","1) Gardening - for as long as I remember, I have enjoyed gardening.  My mother and grandmothers also enjoyed gardening, and I have fond memories of looking at all their plants.
2) Counseling - in college I almost majored in psychology instead of business.  I feel that God has given me the gift of listening and wanting to help people.  I enjoyed being a Stephen Minister for a couple of years, but due to other commitments, I gave it up.  It may be something that I get back into if circumstances change.","1) Prison inmates - my husband and I were called into Kairos Prison Ministry about 15 years ago.  I am on the support team,  but I am so blessed to be a part of sharing the Gospel with these men.  Many of them are overwhelmed that Jesus loves them and that their sins can be forgiven.
2) Recovery - as an adult, our daughter became addicted to drugs.  We sent her to rehab, and I have seen a huge improvement in her life during the past few years.  I am always trying to encourage her.","Listening first and then trying to gently present my thoughts on the issue if necessary.  Always be quick to apologize and ask for forgiveness when I have wronged someone.","By showing others how He is in control and His way is perfect.

That was my journey in learning.","In my late twenties I developed a gift of listening to others as they tell their story. I often try to see the other person’s side if there is any disagreement. By listening to their complete story I’m able to give them advice or counsel. 
This also follows suit with counseling/coaching.

Knowledge and wisdom are essential to establishing a direction or objective. Leadership is needed to head down the established path and reach objectives, and mercy is vital to honor the dignity of all.","I recently picked up old journals and found one from when I was 15. An entry described a day I taught Sunday School to younger kids. I never set out to be a teacher but landed in the field anyway. I was awarded Teacher of the Year early on in my career. I have remained a teacher since 2007, and have taught in church off and on. The greatest challenge was teaching adults in a Bible class.","I have always had a difficult time expressing my state of mind, and mood. As a child I attempted to let it out, which ended up being a tantrum, or some horrible act. As I got older the tantrums and horrible acts continued, just in a more serious manner. Now, I have found ways to peacefully process. During that discovery, I found that my presence with others helped them process too. People are different in what they need, and some struggle greatly, which is why I often work with at-risk children. However, my heart goes to my family and I give them all that I can to help them process and find peace.","I taught adults in a Bible class for several years. The lessons I taught were sometimes met with criticism or hesitation, especially lessons on social justice.

It has been put to use organizing for many rounds of VBS, Sunday school, church and non-church events, and more. I currently use it WDA and (surprisingly) recently used it for the Altar Guild. 

It is a gift I would like to use more in His service, but it is not always a gift I feel He is asking me to use more. While it is a ""top"" gift, I feel like it is often meant to be used to support other gifts and services He leads me to. I am curious to see if He will ask me to use it more in the future, or if His focus will be encouraging me to use some of my ""lesser"" gifts with Admin to support them--kind of like scaffolding.","I have used writing, training, and communication as the WDA leader, when teaching Sunday school, when running VBS...

I would love to use my writing skills more for Him and His Church and I am open to those possibilities....but I do not see them. I wonder if this is not looking hard enough for how to use and apply them....or if He is preparing for something.","I was in an abusive relationship and I taught in very high risk and alternative schools, so the needs of women and families is close to my heart. 

I know how important having someone to support you and believe in you is because I have been to the place where there is no one to champion me and I do not want that for anyone else. 
I am in a space where I have several people championing me and I want that so much for others.","I taught in public schools and was able to reflect the love of Jesus and to teach simple acts of faith simply by having my students watch me. 

Halfway through one school year my 3rd graders asked me why my head was bowed before lunch each day. (I peeked one day and realized most of my class was bowing their heads with me....without knowing why.) I was able to explain that I was thanking God for His blessings and provision in my life. 

I wanted to share that same love with a young couple that was ""in need""--they took me for hundreds of dollars and were serial offenders. And the worst part, was they could quote the Bible more than more Christians I know. I truly believed the Holy Spirit was leading me to so take care of them and share Jesus's love.","I want to strengthen the next generation by strengthening families--especially young parents. I want to be used by God to bring hope and peace by creating small groups where people feel loved, safe, championed, and valued.","Hiking, gardening, writing, and helping others.","I want to have obeyed and done what He asked of me.

I was called to Give as the eldest of three daughters--giving up so that they might have more or have something. My joy came from giving and seeing others receive. It continued in the early years of our marriage even when we had little--inviting others to eat with us, making gifts for others, doing for others. I have been blessed that God has given us much and have been able to give from the heart and out of abundance. I pray that even were I to have very little again, my Giving would continue to grow.","I enjoy managing the training and instruction of others from children to my clients. I enjoy the process of seeing people grow and learn and become more of something--more aware, more educated, my knowledgable, more engaged...that began as a child. I enjoyed instructing others and helping them at school, as a young mother I found myself instructing not only my children but the children of others, as a teacher I enjoyed helping my students to grow, and now I help military members to grow and learn. I am learning to instruct and help others to grow in faith and I have truly enjoyed my own learning in that area.","Because I have always been a teacher and instructor at heart I was drawn early to children and my heart was drawn to those children most at risk. As I have gotten older, I find my heart drawn more specifically to women. I want to see more women filled with Jesus's heart--to know they are chosen, loved, and worthy. I want to help heal the hearts of women so they can seek Christ more fully and embrace the joy of walking with Him.","I always saw ""evangelizing"" as going out and preaching and that did not grab my heart, but I have slowly learned that it looks very different everywhere I go. I lead a women's group that goes walking locally and takes hiking trips and have found that even though discipling is our focus, there is a great deal of evangelizing and allowing Jesus to use us to bring healing and joy and hope to others and that has been such a blessing. I want to dig deeper and identify how else He wants to use me through my passions and hobbies. Hiking has been a great way to see and meet and share Him with others.","I want to meet and share Him with individuals and small groups as I hike, camp, and move about in His creation. I want Him to instruct me in how I can use a love of the outdoors to bring others to Him. I want to be his hands that show those folks who are reveling in His Creation that He is the Creator.","I think they would say I am a kind person who is compassionate about learning, about teaching, about the outdoors and His creation. I hope they would see and know I am inquisitive, that I love to learn, that I love Jesus and want to know Him more, that I struggle but I continue to trust He will guide me where He wants me, and that I am always growing in my faith walk with Him.","I do not want to regret not knowing Him more and not doing more of what He planned for me. I do not want to regret having missed out on knowing and seeing and exploring more of His creation. I do not want to regret and know I fell short on trusting and listening and following Him.","Jan 02, 2024 at 12:47 pm"

Upon learning of someone's difficulty, I would try to help them unpack or resolve whatever struggle they were experiencing.

Service - In my early thirties, I began to experience a new life in Christ and would look for opportunities to be useful whether that was making coffee, setting up rooms, or helping with ministry leaders.  If I wasn't given tasks, I would identify what is normally done and step in to help accomplish tasks so others could focus on more important work they had in front of them.

Hospitality - I enjoy making new-comers comfortable when they walk in.  Perhaps this comes from my gratitude for those that welcomed me so warmly when I first encountered a new church or church groups.  When those around us are welcomed warmly and made to feel part of the group, my experience is they are more likely to return.","Coaching - I began to work through Celebrate Recovery about 20 years ago and was frequently in situations similar to life-coaching for our members.  Many of those relationships continue today and I have gotten consistent feedback that their live improved from the work we did together.

Cooking - As a child of a single mother, I frequently would cook dinner for the family to help out.  As I got older, I took a larger interest in cooking, own a spice company, and enjoy cooking for larger groups of people, including Campfire Night.

Carpentry/Construction - As a child, I would often spend time assembling scrap wood in our back yard for various 'fun' projects.  This continued into adulthood and I occasionally engage in small carpenters projects around the house.  Most of my career has also been as a Civil/Structural Engineer.","My early adulthood was a struggle and I seemed to drift aimlessly until my 30's and depend on my own resourcefulness.  In my 30's, I met a man through church that helped me to focus my life on Christ and ultimately helped me to realize that we need each other to thrive and survive.  Through this relationship, I came to believe that I was an at-risk child that could have benefitted from the guidance of a safe adult or friend.

My oldest son is severely autistic and mentally retarded.  I have found great joy in sitting with Jerred Cass during worship service and have become good friends with him.  Because my son has spent most of his life largely non-verbal, I think this has become an opportunity to resolve some of the sadness I've experienced in this part of my life.  Also, I am planning to begin picking him up on Sundays to join us for service, and perhaps expand our 'little group' with other special needs attendees.

Elementary children - My twin 7 y/o's are currently in this group and I enjoy spending time with them and helping to coach my son's baseball team.","Teaching - In High School, I recognized that the teaching styles of some of our math teachers were challenging for some of my peer students.  I was able to realize that slight differences in the style of teaching allowed for them to have a better understanding of course materials and honed my understanding as well.  As I grew in God's word and read through the bible, I found that occasionally I would remember verses or accounts in the bible that were applicable to support others as they went through life circumstances.

Shepherding - As long as I can remember, I have always wanted to be likeable and wanted to enjoy groups of people that were safe, enjoyable, and fun to be a part of.","I would love to be able to help the marginalized (the guy, or kid, who feels he has to figure it out alone, specials needs, the newcomer, etc..) be included and thrive in spite of the challenges they are faced with.","Telling my story, teaching what I know well, and bringing a large group together for the benefit of each of the individuals.","Around 2006, I was approached by a very young man (10ish) who asked if I would give him money for a drink and snack.  I ended up buying a drink and snack for him, but did it with a poor attitude.  A couple miles down the road I realized I had missed an opportunity to show that child God's love.  I don't want to have another situation again where I missed an opportunity to share God's love because of my poor attitude.","Apr 19, 2023 at 7:35 pm"

In high school I worked at a nursing home and in ministry I have been drawn to friendships with elderly people.
Jr High kids are fun. They're trying to figure out who they are and who they want to be. It's fun seeing them work through these ideas.","I have always known that I would teach in some fashion. At first I thought it would be in a classroom, but in high school it transitioned to be as a dce.

The church we were part of as newlyweds had small groups.  We took turns hosting the members weekly, making dinner for the group.  I also hosted a Women's Bible Study at my house within the first year of marriage.  I was blessed with two bold Christian women who modeled hospitality and serving others in need. One especially modeled praying for others.  She was the 2nd person I called, after Dwight, when I went into labor at 28 weeks with our first child.  She rushed over and laid hands on me and prayed. She taught me to turn to the Lord in time of need.  She also taught me how God works through being bold to pray for others right on the spot, not just telling them you'll pray for them, but praying with them right then.","I learned to cook while in elementary school.  We had 8 in our family and usually breakfast and supper were hot meals.  Mom taught me to help with the cooking and I found I enjoyed it. I continued working on my cooking skills after I got married and have cooked for our family and our small groups over the last almost 43 years. Counselling ability grew as my children needed guidance.  Thankful for being a part of a church that taught using the Word as guidance.  Counselling continues as family and friends walk through tough times.  Counselling always incorporates prayer with that person.","My first experience with ministering to women began with my sisters.  I'm the oldest girl with 3 younger sisters.  We got along incredibly well all our life at home together and we still have a very close relationship.  Mom recalls overhearing my 5 year old sister asking me, then 6 years old, if God really had the whole world in His hands and I answered I was sure He did! Later I was part of a weekly Women's Bible Study as a 23 year old newlywed.  I was part of that for over 18 years. I had the opportunity to be ministered to and learned to minister to others during those interactions.  When I moved here and began teaching school, I wasn't able to be apart of a Women's Bible Study, but after several years, I did find the Lord using me to minister to fellow teachers and women in our small group. I see Him using me more in my retirement as He has opened several opportunities for me to pray with women who are going through tough times.  My family passion is really for my own family and for the families within my sphere of influence.","x","By using me to reveal to the world the power of prayer, especially those prayed over someone in person, and the importance of not giving up.  Would love God to work a miracle in the lives of a couple of people I am currently praying for that seem headed for heaven soon.","The power of prayer!","I don't want to miss sharing the Lord with unbelievers because I think I'm not good at it and might embarrass myself and or them.

I attended Bible Studies and was a part of study groups that inspired me to learn more and share what I learned.  I love studying the Bible and discovering new things that I overlooked before.  I enjoy sharing what I learn with friends and family.  I also love sharing scriptures with people experiencing difficult circumstances.  I try to encourage people to read the Bible and to learn how to cope with their specific situations by saturating their minds with scripture and to confidently approach the throne of God.  I love approaching the Bible by topic and encourage others to search out what God has to say about it, not the world.","My ability to organize was beneficial at work.

I am retired and I want to find where I would be the most useful.","I am passionate about children and the elderly.  I do not believe abuse should be tolerated and the people who inflict abuse should be held accountable.  I believe our country has lost its way because we have abandoned our faith and allowed evil to dictate.  I believe that it is extremely important to speak the Truth in the face of adversity and stand firm in our convictions.  My goal is to do whatever I can to expose lies and deception and to lead people to the Lord.  I want to make a positive impact in people's lives and give them hope:  spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically.  We are all in this together.","I have served at Gloria Dei as receptionist, assisted with food preparation for funerals, and other tasks like volunteering to distribute food during disasters when asked but shamefully, I have never been super proactive at church.   I have been hiding because I have been selfish about my time and finances.   I want to change that.","I would like Him to tell them how much I loved listening to Bible stories when I was a young child, and how my faith started to grow back then even though it took years before I accepted Him as my Lord and Savior.  I would like to Him to use whatever part of my 67 year old journey He would like to tell: the lessons, the hardships, the mistakes, the joys and triumphs, the walks we have had and about the times I ventured off and He brought me back.  I would like Him to share it all because it's a wonderful story and because it might be useful to help someone struggling with their own story.","They would say I am passionate about the God, the Bible, the Nation, stomping out evil, demolishing lies and deception about Jesus and telling them the Truth.  I am passionate about pro-life, treating the elderly with dignity and respect, about putting leaders with integrity into office, and righting the wrongs in this Nation.

I would spend days helping him work on the cars and doing projects around the house.","With my gift of craftsmanship, its only fitting that my ability of mechanical would be a top pick.

I enjoy creating metaphors and pictures that help, explain concepts, bit spiritual, or biblical concepts or business concept as well.

Throughout my life, I have enjoyed gathering people in my home, and providing them with a time of relaxation and joy.

I am fairly quick to discern truth in a situation, and to share that truth with others.
